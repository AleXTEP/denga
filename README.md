# Story
I'm a fan of Agenda :star: , and I'm using it in several projects for a very long time. And I've always used, Agendash as the dashboard, But I must say, it wasn't created to cover all the various situations (I've spent too many hours writing MongoDB queries). 

So making Denga is a way to save some time.
